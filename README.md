# CS 100 Programming Project
A) Group Members: Mariam Razak (mraza008@ucr.edu) and Maya Fall (mfall003@ucr.edu)

B) Title of Project: Catform

C) What it is: We will be working on a platform game where the player (who plays as a cat) will overcome obstacles in order to progess and earn points. Should the character collide with the obstacles instead of avoiding them, the game will end until the player chooses to re-play.

D) This game will be interesting because it is one that we have not attempted to create before and will be fun for the users because it will be interactive, challenging, and cute due to the characters and obstacle graphics. 

E) We plan to use C++, GitHub, and PuTTy/terminal for now. 

F) The input is the user input from the keys controlling the movements and the output is the movement of the character (ie jumping, ducking, etc.) as well as the visuals.
